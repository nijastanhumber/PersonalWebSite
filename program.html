<h1>Chronicles of the Demon Slayer</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone! My first new game is finally out!!! As you can see above, the game is called "Chronicles of the Demon Slayer." It is a text-based rpg adventure game. Even though our programming teacher hasn't taught us much programming, I went out of my way to learn as much as I can. After countless hours of blood, sweat and tears (well not literally but you get the idea), I finally made a game that I can say I'm very proud of.<figure class="pic1"><img class="pic1" src="images/gamemenu.png" width="400" height="200"><figcaption style="color:cyan;font-size:70%;text-align:center;">Game menu for chronicles of the demon slayer</figcaption></figure> The game gives you the option of choosing between 3 classes; a warrior, a trojan or a ninja. You are sent by the Kingdom of Falador to beat the Demon King. The game's combat system is turn based similar to the pokemon games. You have to level your character up by fighting the different monsters available until you are strong enough to face the boss. You can fight goblins, ogres, lesser demons and greater demons. Now I know some of you people might be wondering why the names I chose for the monsters or cities sounds familiar. Well, it's from Runescape.
<br> I know, I know, I should have came up something on my own but I was a bit pressed for time. <figure class="pic2"><img class="pic2" src="images/gameintro.png" width="500" height="200"><figcaption style="color:cyan;font-size:70%;text-align:center;">Introduction to chronicles of the demon slayer</figcaption></figure>Since this game is completely text, I decided to use ASCII characters for images and color coded text to make the gaming experience much better. Since our teacher for game programming is going to mark me on my game, I couldn't make the game too long. So the leveling system in the game is pretty simplistic and you can get the maximum level of 10 in about 15 minutes. The game also incorporates a combat system that involves dodging with stat bonuses upon leveling. Of course, these things are all expected for any game you play but for beginners and especially on your own, it can be a challenge. Luckily my math skills helped out a lot here. I'm confident that at the moment, my game should be the most advanced out of my class block. But compared to the other classes, I can't be sure because they all have a better teacher than us so they might know more stuff about programming. Nevertheless, I'm going to showcase my game to different people and get reviews. At this point, I'm very much ahead of my work and I am going to continue to perfect myself by learning all there is about game programming. I might even decide to make a sequal to this game in the future. So stay tuned.</p>
