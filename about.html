<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Nijastan and I'm from Toronto, Canada. I'm a 26 years old student studying to become a game programmer at Humber College. I've previously did engineering and got my degree in it but upon graduation, I felt I was not interested in the field anymore. From a young age, I was always a computer wiz and consumed a lot of media. More specifically, video games and lots of anime/cartoons.
<br></br>
But when I got older, I went with engineering not because I was particularily interested in it but because I did good in math and science so I thought it might suite me well. Little did I know that I chose wrong. Upon graduating, I was looking for work but it would involve me having to move to the freezing north-west of Canada working at the oil fields there. The prospect did not interest me whatsoever so I ended up working at a hardware company unrelated to engineering in Toronto for over a year. During that time, I watched some of my friends and relatives do a bit of programming for games and observed them for a bit. The process intrigued me and seeing as how I was still an avid gamer, it struck me why in the world did I not think about this option earlier. That is when I realized my true calling in game programming and decided to change career paths. I am enjoying every moment of my new future and I am actually working on my first game for a final project. I've met many new friends and colleagues and I look forward to becoming an accomplished game programmer!
<br></br>
My website showcases everything about myself, my interests and hobbies,  my day-to-day life and progress in game programming. I hope you guys enjoy my site and follow along on my adventure. If you require me for any collaboration, click on the "contact" link above.
