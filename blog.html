<h1 style="color:#04B404">Exams, projects, and a whole bunch of stuff...</h1>
<img src="images/study.gif" width="720" height="292">
<p>Well, its that time of year again. Exams are coming up and projects are bombarded at us. Luckily for me, I'm getting ahead of my work while I'm guessing most of my classmates are probably binging out on Fallout 4. My website which I'm designing (and is what you see here obviously) is probably the biggest task I have next to the text-based rpg game I have to make for programming class. Which is another thing I have to vent about. Our programming teacher has taught us almost nothing this whole semester. He didn't show up for 2 classes, couldn't get visual studios running for several classes, randomly lets us out early, is completely unorganized and is all over the place when teaching.
<br></br>
At this point, I don't think anyone is able to program a game. He once referred us to watch this 9 hour tutorial video on C# on the Microsoft site since he knew he couldn't possibly catch up. I'm actually one of the very few people in class that probably went through the whole thing and still I don't think I know as much as the other blocks that are taking the same course with a different teacher. We had a quiz a few days ago and I think the class totally bombed it. It was literally the first marked thing we've had all semester (we had no midterm, assignments or anything so far) and majority of the questions were stuff he did not teach at all. Luckily since I watched the online lessons, I didn't do too bad but can't say that much for everyone else. Now it all depends on the text-based rpg I make. I'm going to make sure I do my best and make the greatest game of all time! Well... at least out of the whole class :P
<br></br>
Wish me luck everyone!</p>

<h1 style="color:#04B404">Gameopalooza</h1>
<img src="images/controller.png" width="300" height="300">
<p>Man, what a fun night it was. Gameopalooza is an event set up specifically for game programming students like me. All the different class blocks in our program can choose to attend and it is located at the Linx Lounge which is Humber's oncampus pub. Games are set up from good old Nintendo console games like Tetris to everyone's all time favourite Super Smash Brothers on Wii. There were several tvs and consoles set up with competitions that anyone can sign up for. My friends and I signed up for Tetris and it was fun. I did better out of my friends but not anywhere near the best. Meanwhile, we were also having some drinks and chatting away. It has been a while since I was able to let myself loose like this. Recently, we had midterms so everyone was stressed and on edge but this was the perfect opportunity to get away from all that. Not to mention I haven't done anything this socially fun since school started and I was really looking forward to the night. There were also booths set up by final year game programming students who were showcasing their games to everyone else. I checked them out and it was pretty cool. There was a temple run-like game and an oculus set up. It was my first time using an oculus so it amazed me how I was immensed into a virtual reality-like world.
<br></br>
Later on, there was a musical recital on stage set up by our program coordinators. The game was to guess what video game the songs being played were from. My friend managed to guess most of the songs and I got some of it. What really psyched me up was when they started playing songs from the Zelda games like Ocarina of Time. This is a game that I beat multiple times when I was young so hearing those songs being played was very nostalgic. Afterwards, my friends and I finally managed to get an open seat to face each other on Super Smash Brothers while getting tipsy. Getting drunk and playing Super Smash Brothers, can you think of anything more fun?! :D
<br></br>
All in all, this was a night to remember. The best I've had at Humber so far!</p>

<h1 style="color:#04B404">First movie night at Humber</h1>
<img src="images/jurassic.jpg" width="600" height="300">
<p>So its the 3rd week of school and I've met a bunch of people in my program. My classes are going well and there hasn't been much to do. I have been following the humber website for events and I noticed today is movie night and they are playing Jurassic World! This seems like the perfect opportunity to experience something new. Since I moved out of my parents house (for good!) to a new area, life has been a little dull. I'm new to the area and none of my old friends live near me.
<br></br>
Its Tuesday so I have classes until 9pm and the movie starts at 7 but luckily, our teacher let us out early. So I went with a friend who lives on residence and we attended movie night. They had marshmellows smores and popcorn and the movie was great! I had fun! I look forward to more fun times at Humber.</p>
